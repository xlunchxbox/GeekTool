===========

Ruby Weather Script.

3 Files
	Current Temp
	High Temp
	Low Temp

Check xmlscript.rb and edit the link and change the w=2424766 to match your city code.

I then setup a crontab to run the sh file and execute the xmlscript every 30 minutes.

The three geeklets pull from the xml.txt generated.
